Standard Units
==============
TAZ uses the following standard units throughout the code.

| Value          | Units |
|:-------------- |:-----:|
| Mass           | amu   |
| Nuclear Radius | fm    |
| Channel Radius | fm    |
| Energy         | eV    |
| Partial Widths | meV   |
| Level Density  | 1/eV  |

**Note:** the units for partial widths can are arbitary as long as it is consistent.
